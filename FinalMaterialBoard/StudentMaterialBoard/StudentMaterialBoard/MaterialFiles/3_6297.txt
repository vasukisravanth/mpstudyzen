5.System for Identifying Fake Product using Blockchain Technology

Abstract:
Counterfeit items have become more prevalent in the industrial industry in recent years. This has an effect on the company’s name, sales, and profit. Blockchain technology is used to authenticate and identify counterfeit items.Using blockchain technology, transactions are recorded in the form of blocks in a distributed, decentralized, and digital ledger. A block cannot be changed or hacked since blockchain technology is secure. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for customers or users to rely on third parties to verify the product’s safety. In light of current advancements in mobile and wireless technologies, quick response (QR) codes provide a promising technique for addressing the practice of counterfeiting in this project. This is done by scanning a QR code, which is linked to a Blockchain, to identify counterfeit goods. As a consequence, this method may be used to record product information and generate a unique identifier for each product in a database. It looks up the user’s unique code in the Blockchain database and sees if there are any matches. When a code matches, the client will be notified; otherwise, the consumer will be notified that the product is counterfeit.


6.A Blockchain-based Document Verification Model in Freshers Hiring Process

Abstract:
A quick growth of information sharing and transferring has been observed recently. Everything is getting digitized, and everyone requires a simple and straightforward method. As a result, the number of fake documents generated for job applications is increasing, and checking all the documents manually is not a good option as it takes a lot of time. Therefore, digitizing documents is becoming an increasingly popular option for companies and individuals as it is the most secure and least time-consuming way of verifying documents. As Blockchain is a decentralized system that guarantees the protection of data kept in it, this article proposes a solution based on Federated Blockchain technology that allows specific organizations to submit candidates' original documents. It validates the student's submitted document hash value by comparing the existing cryptographic hash in the Blockchain. SHA-512 is used to generate the hash values for the documents. This technique is incredibly efficient, consumes less time, and is less expensive to execute all types of verifications.

7.Leveraging Technology to Enhance Effective Electronic Policing in Developing Countries

Abstract:
In Namibia, the introduction of electronic policing (e-policing) has brought changes in the organisation of Police work, mainly recording, storing, and sharing of Police information electronically for the betterment of Police service delivery. The introduction of e-policing in Namibia also came with challenges such as backlog of cases not updated on time. The purpose of this study is to assess the challenges brought by implementing e-policing and propose better strategies to curb the challenges. A quantitative approach was used to analyze data obtained through structured questionnaires. The research aims to focus on the following sub-objectives: to assess the current organisation policy on e-policing system; to investigate the challenges of implementing e-policing, and recommend strategies that can be used for a successful implementation of e-policing through studying relevant literatures. The research identified that Police officers understand e-policing differently and the major challenge faced by the organisation is budgetary fund allocation.

8.DD-Locker: Blockchain-based Decentralized Personal Document Locker
Abstract:
Document verification is the first step whenever we enter any organization or institute. In any organization, it is essential to track, verify, and check the person’s background who will become a part of the organization. This process is very time-consuming and hectic for both parties involved. Various governments provide cloud-based digital locker services for the citizens storing the public document on a centralized server. But due to its centralized nature, this type of service is weak against information breaches and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Also, there are some privacy concerns with such centralized digital locker services as the stored documents may contain users’ crucial personal information. This paper proposes a blockchain-based digital locker in a decentralized application using Ethereum Blockchain to securely store personal documents with high availability. The proposed solution also verifies documents with ease, confidentiality, access control, data privacy, authenticity, and maintaining the integrity of documents.

9.Identifying Counterfeit Products using Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain System

Abstract:
With the advent of globalization and the evergrowing rate of technology, the volume of production as well as ease of procuring counterfeit goods has become unprecedented. Be it food, drug or luxury items, all kinds of industrial manufacturers and distributors are now seeking greater transparency in supply chain operations with a view to deter counterfeiting. This paper introduces a decentralized Blockchain based application system (DApp) with a view to identifying counterfeit products in the supply chain system. With the rapid rise of Blockchain technology, it has become known that data recorded within Blockchain is immutable and secure. Hence, the proposed project here uses this concept to handle the transfer of ownership of products. A consumer can verify the product distribution and ownership information scanning a Quick Response (QR) code generated by the DApp for each product linked to the Blockchain.

10.Food Supply Chain Traceability System using Blockchain Technology

Abstract:
Agricultural sector plays a major role in a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The existing Food Supply Chain (FSC) suffers from issues like quality, safety, conscious consumption, and regulatory issues. Blockchain technology is a promising technology that can handle all the short comes faced by the current FSC with its key multidimensional features like decentralization, immutability, security, and smart contract. Introducing blockchain technology to FSC systems enhances sustainability and ensures trust among different entities. The blockchain-based FSC system suffers from data handling capability and regulatory issues. In this paper, the problems of the existing blockchain-based FSC system are overcome by introducing a new Food Supply Chain Traceability System (FSCTS) using an Ethereum smart contract linked to an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) which can handle huge amount of data. The interaction between the different entities is elaborated using sequence diagrams through the proposed cryptocurrency called Amrita Virtual Coin (AVCoin) which overcomes regulatory compliances. The paper also discusses the implementation of the proposed frameworks using enhanced algorithms and its advantages over the existing framework. Finally, different types of open research challenges in the blockchain-based FSC are also addressed in the paper.

11.Performance Analysis of E-Certificate Generation and Verification using Blockchain and IPFS
Abstract:
From many years to the present, people have used strong copies of degree certificates as proof of graduation. But in recent days, due to advanced technology, these certificates have been forged. As a result, undeserving people get job opportunities, which tarnish the image of these paper certificates. Therefore, overcoming such certification problems using blockchain technology is encouraged. Blockchain is a system of storing information that makes it difficult or impossible to repair, hack a system, ad save paper costs. With the help of the blockchain, an anti-forge, fixed, electronic-certified electronic certificate is produced. Students will not be able to manipulate the content of e certificates. The function of this system is that: a computer file (e-file) of the certificate i.e. The institution produces the electronic certificate At the same time, that student's record is kept in blockchain blocks using hash values. The hash value is generated from the interplanetary file system (IPFS) network. Accompanying electronic certificate, associated unique serial number (unique id) were also given to the applicant. The searching system (e.g. The Company the applicant applied for) can verify the authenticity of the electronic file using a unique hash value based on the data stored in the blockchain. The proposed method improves the performance concerning storage and speed.
