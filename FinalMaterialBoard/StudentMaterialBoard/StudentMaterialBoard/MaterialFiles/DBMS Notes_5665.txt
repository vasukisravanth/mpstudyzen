Software Testing?

What is Software?

A software is a collectionn of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.

Type Software
 -system software
 -Programming Software
 -Application Software--Web Applications,Desktop Application,Mobile Application
amazon online shopping

Program?
Instruction written to the computer coding to run application

web application:FB,LI,amazon etc

desktop:Notepd,mspaint,claculator

Tesing is done on application software
What is an software Testing?

A--> mobile purchase sm31
check options working--use mobile phone & apps

A--MP sm31-18000

hangout--

testing--lack of testing not done properly

m32 product

Banking Application

Net banking

x--bank y-company -specify x bank req

login a/c 20000
amount z transfer 15000/20000


balance Rs.5000

s/w testing?
--S/w Testing is an part of s/w develpment Process.
--Test the s/w ie., working according to clent Req
--s/w testing is an activity to detect & identify the defects in the s/w
--The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client

S/w Quality?--Parameter to evaluate S/w Quality

--Bug free
--On Time Delivered
--Within budget
--Meet requirements/Expectations
--Maintainable


Project Vs Products?

Project:If S/w application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then
it is called Project
Ex:Banking Application,online shopping website etc


Product:If s/w application is developed for multiple customers based on market
requirement then it is called Product

Ex:Google Drive,Google Map
Microsoft product-MS Word,MS Excel etc

Why do we need Testing?
--bug free deliver application
--Quality of s/w

Error,Bug & Failure?

Error:Developer write code & if any mistake in code,then it is Error(Developer End).

Bug/Defect:Tester test the application,if actual result does not match with
Expected Result,then it is called Bug/Defect (Tester End).

Failuer:Develop s/w & tested everything work fine.Delivered to customer,install s/w
in customer environment & start using the s/w.After few days,something not working
i.e., some transaction fail,end user identify error it is called
failure(Client End).

Levels of Testing

1.Unit Testing
-A unit is a single component or module of a s/w.
-Unit Testing conduct on a single program or single module.
-Unit Testing is white box testing technique.
-Unit testing is conducted by the developers.

2.Integration Testing
-Integration Testing is performed b/w 2 or more modules
-Integration testing focus on checking data communication b/w multiple modules
-Integration Testing is white box testing technique

Ex:Gmail

Login-->Inbox--select mail(check)--click on Delete-->Tash/Delete mail

login--compose mail---send mail--check in sent item(verify mail send successfully)

3.System Testing
-Testing over all functionality of the application with respective
client requirements.
-It is a black box testing technique.
-This testing is conducted by testing team/tester's
-Before conducting System Testing,we should know the Customer Requirement

User Interface Testing(GUI)
Functional Testing
Non-Functional Testing
Usability Testing

What is GUI Testing
-GUI Testing is a process of testing the user interface of an application.
-GUI Testing includes all elements such as menu,checkbox,textbox,buttons,colors,
fonts,font size,icons,content & images

GUI Testing checklist
-Testing the size,position,width,height of the element.
-Testing of the Error message that are getting displayed.
-Testing the different section of the screen.
-Testing of the font whether it is readable or not
-Testing of the screen in different resolution with the help of zooming in &
zooming out.
-Testing the alignment of the text & other elements like icons,buttons etc
are in proper place or not.
-Testing the color of the fonts.
-Testing whetherthe image has good clarity or not.
-Testing the alignment of the image
-Testing of the spelling.
-The user must not get frustrated while using the system interface.
-Testing whether the interface is attractive or not.
-Testing of the scrollbar according the size of the page if any.
-Tesing of the disabled fields if any.
-Testing UI Element properly align with respective height & width in client requirement.

Usability Testing
-Check how easily the end user are able to understand & operate the application
is called usability testing.

user manual document
should be simple english i.e., non-technical person should understand the document.

Functional Testing

Functionality is nothing but behavior of application
How your feature should work

Functional Testing
--Object Properties Testing
--Database Testing
--Error Handling
--Calculations/Manipulation Testing
--Link Existence & Link Execution
--Cookies & session

Object Properties Testing
--Check the properties of object Present on the application

Database Testing/Backend Testing

--Table level validation{column Type,data type
varchar(20),

grey box testing
--combination of white box & black box testing


normalization
functions
store procedure
view
triggers

Error Handling Testing
Testing on Error Message
Ex:Login form 
Invalid action,invalid operation on UI

Invalid User Id,Password input 
error message

Application should display messages for incorrect operation to the user.
Error message should be reable
user understanable/simple language.

Calculation/Manipulation Testing

Ex:Bank transaction
proper working or not

Add Number
Num 1 -2
Num 2-5
result-7

-2,5
0
-2,-5
bigger no
smaller no
alpha

LinkExistence & Link Execution

where exactly the link are placed-- link existence

link are navigating to proper page or not -- link execution

three type of link

--Internal link
--same page with different section

-External link
-Navigate to another page

Broken Link
-Link will be their,but doesn't have any action,not navigate to any page


Cookies & Sessions

-->Only for Web Application


cookies

Ex:Browser Page(data)<--- Data(server side)
   Save-User
    Data
client side(Data) Remember Password/EmailId

Id&Password-->Login to application -->Browser popup--do you want remember
Id,Password--Yes(Save)-without click logout,close page.Browser Remember Data

-Cookies are file/temp file created by the browser while browsing data through
internet.
-Testing whether browser saving the information in cookies or not.

Session

--Create on server side

Ex:Gmail/Banking Application

--Login
--Without any Activity leave few minutes.
--Certain minutes after do some action,again it will ask for login
input username & password(session expire)--due to security process.

In application an Timer will count the application is active or not(time slot)
-for security purpose.

--Session are time slots created by the server.Session will be expired after some time(If the application is idle for some time).

Non-functional Testing

-->Performance Testing
   ->Load Testing
   ->Stress Testing
   ->Volume Testing
-->Security Testing
-->Recovery Testing
-->Compatibility Testing
-->Configuration Testing
-->Installation Testing
-->Sanitation/Garbage Testing


End-To-End Testing

Testing the overall functionlities of the system including the data integration among all the modules is called End-To-End testing.

Example 1:
login->Add customer-->Edit customer--->Logout
						 -->Delete Customer

1.Login
2.Add New Customer
3.Edit Customer
4.Delete Customer
5.Logout

In single flow/complete functionality start to end testing in single flow.


Example 2:
Shopping Application

1.Visit Shopping APplication
2.Login
3.Search Product
4.Add to cart
5.Place order
6.Make payment--Get bank Notification message
7.Get Order Product Notification - delivery date
8.Logout

SDLC--Entire s/w development Process
STLC-Software testing Life cycle.
--only s/w testing process
--STLC is a part of SDLC

Difference Phase in STLC
1.Requirement Analysis.
2.Test Planning
3.Test Design
4.Test Execution.
5.Defect Reporting/Bug Reporting
6.Test Closure.

A test plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy,schedules,estimation,deliverables & resources required to perform testing for a s/w application.
The Test plan helps us determine the effort needed to validate the quality of the
application under test.

Test Designing

Usecase,Test Scenario & Test Case

Usecase:Function requirement part i.e., describes the requirements

Usecase contains 3 items
--Actor
--Action/flow
--Outcome

Actor  Action  outcome
User-->Login-->Home Page
       Invalid-->Error message

Test Scenario:Possible area to be tested(What to test)

TestCase:
-How to test
-Describes test steps,expected result & actual result.

Usecase-->Test Scenario-->Test Case


Usecase vs Test case

--Usecase:Describes functional requirements prepared by Business analyst(BA)
--Testcase:Describes Test steps prepared by Test engineers.

TestCase vs Test Scenarios

Test case consist of set of input values execution precondition,excepted result &
executed post condition,developed to cover certain test condition,while test scenario is nothing but test procedure.

Test case are derived(or written) from test scenario.The scenario are derived from use case.

In short Test scenario is "what to be tested" & test case is "How to be Tested".

Example:
Use case:Test Login Form Functionality
Test Scenario:Checking the functionality of Login Button
TC1:Click the button without entering username & password.
TC2:Click the button only entering Username.
TC3:Click the button while entering wrong Username & Wrong Password.

Test Case:Is a set of actions executed to verify. a particular feature or functionality of the application.
